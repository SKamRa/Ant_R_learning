# Ant_R_learning 

Ant_R_learning is a try to make a reinforcement learning project but instead it went in a "best" choice learning if i could say.
The project is simple, there is a grid of x tiles and 3 types of tile.
-  Brown is the ant
-  Red is a fruit
-  White is an empty tile


The goal is the ant has to eat the fruits in the smallest time.
The first goal was to make an introduction into reinforcement learning by implementing an RL algorithm inside the project. Initially there would be walls so the "shortest distance" algorithm wouldn't work but instead of that I'll start a new project which you can follow the advancement in my freshly new repository (i don't know how i'll name it yet). It'll be a life simulation like the Bibites if u know, (if u don't this is a very interesting project so follow it around https://www.youtube.com/@TheBibitesDigitalLife). 
My new project will be the project i wanted to make with Ant-R-learning so follow it around.
I'll also make an intro to Genetic learning like Flappy Bird in a small project to prepare the new project.
